Maven - Maven is a software to build a software project.
It is primarily used to compile the project, add dependencies to it, manage versions, run tests, package code(in jar or war) and deploy it(save it to a location)

Maven manages project lifecycle by convention, i.e it has a pre defined project structure to put code, resources and test etc.

src-main
     |_ java - All java files
     |_ resources - all non java files
     |_ test -- All test classes
     
 maven goals are project steps that we can execute using maven like clean, compile, test, package, deploy
 and these goals are combined in one goal called install.
